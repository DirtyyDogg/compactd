# Compactd

(pronounce compact-ed)

Just as a Compact Disc is the evolution of tapes, Compactd is an evolution of
cassette. It aims to be a self-hosted remote music player in your browser,
streaming from you own personal server. It will also allows to download new
music onto your server just like headphones does.

## Why?

I felt like the next version (1.0), while full of new features, began to be
cluttered and slow, relying on outdated technologies when new exciting
things are up. Since I'm not trying to be profitable, but rather I code for the
fun, and I like to discover new things and new patterns I decided to go for
PouchDB which looks really interesting and promising!

Also, I've been relying a lot on boilerplates, and I'd like to learn to
implement all of this myself :D

##Â Stack

I plan to use React, Redux, Reselect, PouchDB (ofc!)...
